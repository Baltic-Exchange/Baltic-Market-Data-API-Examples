# Python example


* Get your **API Key** and **Feed ID** from the Market Data API Portal: https://api.balticexchange.com
* Ensure Python 3 is installed
* Run the **main.py** file

The script will prompt you for you **API Key** and **Feed ID**. Once entered, you'll see the JSON output from the two calls:

* Last datum change on
* Get data

You can also run the script with arguments like this:

    main.py --feedid [your feed id] --apikey [your api key]

For more information about making calls, please see the documentation.
